# What are assets?

Assets are a container for data that describes a physical entity like a piece of equipment, process, or concept. Assets provide contextualization and organization of streams and metadata.

You may optionally apply a type to assets. Typed assets reference an asset type and comply with metadata and stream reference definitions. Typed assets can define metadata and stream references not contained in the asset type; however, they cannot skip defining metadata and stream references defined by the asset type. Untyped assets do not need to adhere to the constraints of an asset type.

For additional information about the asset API and asset type properties, see [Assets](xref:AssetsProperties).
