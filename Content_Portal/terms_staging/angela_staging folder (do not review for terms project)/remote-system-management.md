# Remote system management

Use remote system management within OCS to visualize and organize Edge System health information, configure Edge Systems, and manage Edge System configuration.  It provides a centralized location to monitor the health and manage the configuration of Edge Data Store and PI Adapter installations on remote devices, referred to collectively as Edge Systems. You can view detailed health information for your Edge Systems from the OCS portal and use this information to understand the overall health of these Edge Systems. Use remote asset management to sort and filter Edge Systems to pinpoint problems, identify gaps in data collection, and understand your entire edge data collection landscape. Additionally, any PI Interfaces that are configured to send health messages directly to OCS are included in the health information.

Remote system management provides a centralized location to create, edit, and manage Edge System configuration and manually apply new or updated configurations to Edge Systems. You can manually reconcile configuration changes made in the field with configuration created in the OCS portal.

Remote system management provides the following:
 - Connectivity at scale - provides a centralized and easy way to collect and manage all the data from remote sites.
 - Robust edge computing platform – prioritize and plan using a single display to view the status of all remote assets with specific details about any assets with questionable status.
 - Asset visibility – provides asset monitoring and configuration management giving you visibility into the data collection solution.
