# What is OSIsoft Message Format (OMF)?

The OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) defines a set of message headers and message bodies that you can use to generate compliant messages for inputting data into either an on-premises PI System, OSIsoft Cloud Services, or another compliant backend system.

You can use OMF for programmatic access to data, enabling you to integrate data collection directly into a device or asset. Because OMF does not depend on a particular binary message protocol, such as HTTP, you can use OMF to develop data-acquisition applications on platforms and in languages for which there is no native support. 

OMF is based on an abstract message type, where a message consists of a set of key and value pairs, which may include binary files, configuration files, and batch or Shell scripts. You can construct OMF messages using any message protocol that defines headers and bodies.

Refer to [OMF Message Format](https://omf-docs.osisoft.com/) for more information about the OMF specification.
