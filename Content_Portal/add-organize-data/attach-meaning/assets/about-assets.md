# Organize steams with assets

Use the asset explorer in the OCS Portal to create assets and visualize selected data streams and properties for troubleshooting and analysis of the associated devices or entities. You can create assets on an ad hoc basis or create them from an asset type, which acts as a template for creating similar assets.

Asset types are a template that is used to create multiple assets with similar properties. Assets created from asset types have the following characteristics:

I deleted the metadata section, we dont need it.

Stream Type references - A collection of named references to streams that asset instances of the asset type are expected to provide. The name functions as a key identifying the relationship between asset of the referenced Stream. 

For more information on assets, see [Assets](xref:WhatOCSdoes#assets).
