# Issues template
Draft of issues template in markdown for capturing feedback

## Title
If possible, the title should be auto-generated with the name of the file.
For example, it should say _Sequential Data Store_ in the title if that's where the user clicked the link to "Improve this doc"

## Content template

_How can we make this documentation better? We value your feedback and use it to improve the content._
