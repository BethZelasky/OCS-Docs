# Search for an installed agent

You can search for registered PI to OCS Agents that have been installed on host machines at your organization.  The global filter feature allows you to search for agents by name, status, version number, hostname, PI Data Archive or AF server name, region, and namespace.  

Use the global filter to filter down a large list of Agents to only ones of interest.  For example, you may want to remove or uninstall older Agents.


1.    In the OCS portal window, click the waffle menu icon.

2. Click **PI to OCS Agents under Data Flow.

   **Result:** The **PI to OCS Agents** window opens.

3. In the **Filter Agents** text box, enter the first few characters of the agent's name or version number.  

   **Result:** If there is a match, any agents that meet the filter criteria are displayed in the window.
