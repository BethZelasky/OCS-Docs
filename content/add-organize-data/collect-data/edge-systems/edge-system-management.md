# Edge systems

Edge Systems provides a centralized location to monitor the health and manage the configuration of edge systems on remote devices, including Edge Data Store and PI Adapters, giving you visibility into the data collection solution. Create, edit, and manage edge system configuration and manually apply new or updated configurations to edge systems. You can manually reconcile configuration changes made in the field with configurations created in the OCS portal. Prioritize and plan using a single display to view the status of your edge systems and review specific details about systems with questionable status. View detailed health information for your edge systems and use this information to understand the overall health of these edge systems. Use Edge Systems to sort and filter edge systems to pinpoint problems and identify gaps in data collection. Additionally, any PI Interfaces that are configured to send health messages directly to OCS are included in the health information.
