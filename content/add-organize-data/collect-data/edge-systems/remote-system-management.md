# Remote system management

Use remote system management within OCS to visualize and organize Edge System health information, configure Edge Systems, and manage Edge System configuration. It provides a centralized location to monitor the health and manage the configuration of edge systems on remote devices, including Edge Data Store and PI Adapters giving you visibility into the data collection solution. Prioritize and plan using a single display to view the status of your remote systems and review specific details about systems with questionable status. View detailed health information for your edge systems from the OCS portal and use this information to understand the overall health of these edge systems. Use remote system management to sort and filter edge systems to pinpoint problems and identify gaps in data collection. Additionally, any PI Interfaces that are configured to send health messages directly to OCS are included in the health information.

Remote system management provides a centralized location to create, edit, and manage Edge System configuration and manually apply new or updated configurations to Edge Systems. You can manually reconcile configuration changes made in the field with configurations created in the OCS portal.
