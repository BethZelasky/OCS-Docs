# Read data

The .NET and REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write data. This section identifies and describes 
the APIs used to read [SdsStreams](xref:sdsStreams) data. Results are influenced by [SdsTypes](xref:sdsTypes), [SdsStreamViews](xref:sdsStreamViews), [filter expressions](xref:sdsFilterExpressions), and [table format](xref:sdsTableFormat).

If you are working in a .NET environment, convenient SDS Client Libraries are available. 
The `ISdsDataService` interface, which is accessed using the ``SdsService.GetDataService()`` helper, 
defines the functions that are available.
